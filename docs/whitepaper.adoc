= Cute NFT
:toc:

== Goals
Cute NFT is a fictional NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) octopus trading platform used as a SUT (System Under Test) for training purposes. The goals of this platform are:

- Mediation of the methodical procedure for the creation of BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) test suites with Gherkin, Cucumber, Serenity BDD, and the screenplay pattern.
- Training of 3-amigos and feature mapping sessions on a fictitious use case
- Training in creating concrete test scenario specifications for acceptance and end-to-end testing with Gherkin
- Training in the implementation of automated test scenarios using Cucumber, Serenity BDD and the screenplay pattern

The main goal of Cute NFT in a playful sense is quite simple:
Profit and/or NFT maximization!

== Octopus
These cute little creatures are the focus of the entire platform.
To give you a sense of how these manifest, get acquainted with _Andy_, _Tate_ and _Walt_.

Beside their name and their cute appearance, these little creatures have a few further properties which are described below.

=== Name
An octopus' name is randomly generated by the system (let's say by the parents) at the time of birth and cannot be changed throughout its lifetime.

An octopus' name is not unique throughout the system and won't be ever used for identification.

=== Identifier
Every octopus is assigned a unique identifier at birth which will never change during the lifetime of an octopus.

=== Gender
Every octopus has a gender which is determined at birth and won't change during the lifetime. Octopuses have only to sexes, namely _male_ and _female_. The gender of an octopus is encoded in the MSB (most significant bit) of the genome.

=== Genome
Not all octopuses are the same. Octopuses are the product of their parents and the environment in which they live. Every octopus has its own genome which is determined at birth and won't change during the lifetime.

The genome is represented by a single `long` (64 bits) and does not only influence the appearance of an octopus but also their fitness.

=== Fitness
The fitness of octopus is directly based on their genome and thus won't change during their lifetime either. However, fitness is independent of gender (MSB).

The calculation of the fitness is quite simple and takes only the genome into account.

An Octopus with the genome (excluding the gender at the MSB) consisting of only `1`-Bits, would have the highest fitness of `100`. So for example a genome represented by `Long.MAX_VALUE` would produce a _male_ and `-1` a _female_ Octopus with a fitness of `100`.

On the other hand a genome represented by `0` would produce a _male_ and `Long.MIN_VALUE` a _female_ Octopus with the fitness of `0`.

== Cute NFT Use-Cases

=== The Role of the public key
The Cute NFT platform does not provide a registration in a classical sense. Cute NFT heavily relies on cryptographic methods for registration and authentication.

The HTTP header `pub-key` is used for both registration and authentication and transports the Public RSA Key of the user as a Base64 encoded String. With this header the platform is able to identify the user and moreover able to verify the authenticity of the requests.

Stealing the Public RSA Key of a user is not an issue, because in most cases the key is only used for identifying the user and filtering the result e.g. showing the inventory of a specific user. As the platform is designed in an open manner, this information are available to any user anyway.

On the other hand, POST requests (which create or alter resources on the server) usually require a signature with the according Private RSA Key. By this mechanism the platform can ensure that only the owner of the private key can perform such operations on the platform (e.g. selling inventory).

=== Registration
New users have to register on the platform first. After a successful registration the user receives a welcome bonus which consists of one _male_ and one _femal_ Octopus, and additionally 400 coins.

Already registered users are not allowed to register again and thus will not receive the welcome more than once.

==== Username
On registration a user can choose a readable username. This username does not need to be unique throughout the whole system (and won't be checked for such properties). The username is only meant for a human friendly identification. The system will always identify the user by its public key.

The username can be provided on the registration request through a JSON body `{"userName": "Tish Hughes"}`

In case no username is provided, the system will generate automatically a funny username for you.

==== User credentials
There is no need for classic user credentials on Cute NFT. Still, you have to keep you private key private, and your public key always at hand.

=== Octopus Trading
As a trading platform, Cute NFT allows users to sell their own octopuses, buy octopuses from other users, in general trade with each other.

=== Reproduction
The reproduction of octopuses is another kind of interaction users can perform with their octopuses.

The mating process can only be performed between octopuses from different users. This means that you cannot mate your own octopuses and thus always require a second user. The mating process follows very specific rules:

- only octopuses of different sexes can be mated.
- the process must be requested by a user and accepted by another user
- a user who receives a mating request for one of its octopuses can also decline the request
- the requester of mating procedure must provide a reward to the other user
- after successful mating, the offspring is assigned to the requester while the owner of the partner octopus is assigned the reward (which is paid by the requester)
